# Tutorial_Pad_with_Screen_Recorder

As we all know we are going through the hard time due to _Pandamic_ situation. Out of all problems one major problem is switching to online mode of study from offline mode. Not only students but teachers also face many problems. Not all teachers have access to proper infrastructure. Keeping this in mind I have developed this web application so that they need not to download different app/softwares for screen-recording and drawing used for explaining different concepts to their students. In this application I integrated a clone of _OpenBoard_ and a _Screen_ _Recording_ app.
